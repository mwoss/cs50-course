                        <b>C++</b> is a general-purpose programming language. It has
                        imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities
                        for low-level memory manipulation.

                It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large
                systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also
                been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
                resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web
                search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space
                probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many
                vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.

                C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known
                as C++17). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998,
                which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes
                these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998,
                C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he
                wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for
                program organization. C++20 is the next planned standard thereafter.

                Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, D, Java, and newer versions of C.
